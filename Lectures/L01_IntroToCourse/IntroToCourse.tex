\frametitle{Scientific Computing (SC)}

\begin{itemize}

\item Scientific computation consists of using computer tools to simulate
  mathematical models of real world systems so that we can better understand and
  predict the system’s behaviour.
\item Examples
\bi
\item Temperature of fuel-pin in nuclear reactor
\item Flow of pollutant in groundwater
\item Displacement of a structure
\item Thickness of cast film
\item Temperature of water in a solar water heating tank over time
\item etc.

\frametitle{Software Engineering (SE)}

\begin{itemize}
\item An area of engineering that deals with the development of software systems that
\begin{itemize}
\item Are large or complex
\item Exist in multiple versions
\item Exist for large period of time
\item Are continuously being modified
\item Are built by teams
\end{itemize}
\item Software engineering is ``application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development,
operation and maintenance of software'' (IEEE 1990)
\item D.\ Parnas (1978) defines software engineering as ``multi-person construction of multi-version software''
\item Like other areas of engineering, software engineering relies heavily on mathematical techniques, especially
logic and discrete mathematics
\item SE might be applied to SC for software certification
